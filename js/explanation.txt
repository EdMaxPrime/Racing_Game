=====Explanation of /js folder=====
1) jquery.js
This is selfexplanatory, visit http://jquery.org for more info on this javascript library.

2) app.js
This is the main javascript file for this game. It triggers itself with $(document).ready(function() {...});
It will contain the car objects and the loop method. Contains all of the information about players and score.

3) canvasutils.js
This is mainly drawing methods for canvas that are very repetitive to type, so they are all fit into nice methods. It is a library of sorts.
Contains methods for rectangles, circles, ellipses, keyboard, mouse, and in the future "text selections on the bitmap canvas"
Important thing to note: the UserInterface class is still a work in progress. It works but may get changed a lot from version to version. It has nothing to do with the canvas, but its not big enough for a separate file.
